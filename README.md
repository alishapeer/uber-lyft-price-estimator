# uber-lyft-price-estimator

Uber and Lyft, two of the most popular ridesharing transportation companies, are constantly being compared.

“Take Uber. It’s Cheaper!”, “...but, Lyft doesn’t surcharge during rush hour”

Especially in the city of Boston, where public transportation means are limited, people are constantly requesting trips and trying to guess which factors will yield the lowest price for their ride. In this project, we take guessing out of the question and will use data and statistical inferencing to explore which factors affect the pricing of your next ride the most.

Using data on various rides in the city of Boston: the time of the ride, the ridesharing company (Uber or Lyft), the weather at the time of the ride, the distance travelled, the pick-up location, the drop-off location, and the type of vehicle requested (UberX, Lyft Shared, etc.), we will explore whether Uber is, in fact, cheaper, whether Lyft does not, in fact, charge a surcharge during rush hour, and whether it actually makes a difference to the cost of your ride if its pouring outside.
